Welcome to this WiP mod.  Hopefully my files make sense.  I have an excel file of all the work to do (it looks big). Broken down:

The body of the town itself is largely set. I need to work on some texturing, but I have the building exteriors and some of the rough interiors (most of them could use some help and personalization)
NPCs are a major need area. We need to script things like events and conversations, create sprites and (my weak area) put them all in the NPC coding machine (the NPC Creator mod should save so much effort eventually)
Adding specialty items like new fish and livestock are lower on the list. I want Ojistah and Tier to be able to sell new animals, eventually.  I have sprites done for British White cows and Valais Blackneck goats for barn animals, and Saxony ducks and Blue Bresse chicken for coop animals.
Finally, adding seasonal textures to the maps and, hopefully, seasonal NPCs, would be great.
